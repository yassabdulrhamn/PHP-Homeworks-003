'Playing host to eight runways and with the capabilities to cater for 130 million passengers every year, Beijing"s new international airport will be among the world"s largest and busiest when it is slated to come online in 2017 (although Istanbul"s recently announced third airport will trump it with a 150 million capacity when it opens in 2018). See also: Could drones replace roads? Air travel has expanded rapidly in China in recent years in line with the country"s booming economy. In 2011, the Chinese government announced plans to increase the total number of airports in the country from 175 to 230 by 2015 to cope with demand. Beijing alone is set to handle between 450 and 500 million passengers every year by then, meaning the city"s existing airports need assistance to cope with the expected rise in demand. Construction of the new airport, which will be situated in the city"s Daxing district, was confirmed in January 2013 and is due to begin in early 2014, according to local media.',
